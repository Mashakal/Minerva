DATA THAT WILL BE HELPFUL:
	- How often does more than root key appear in paths?
		- Knowing this will help:
			> Identify where improvements to suggestions can be made.


DOCUMENTATION, WHY LOG IT?:

Bot.Agent.Agent.clarify.validate_input
	- What: 
		The number of valid options being returned.
	- Message:  
		  We want this number to be low.  Why? The purpose
		of the function clarify is to narrow down selections so that
		the user can get a better suggestion from the bot.
		  When there are more than one option being returned as valid
		as valid input it is usually an indication of less than
		desirable interpretation of the user's query prior to clarify
		being called, which is logic that is decoupled from the method 
		clarify entirely.

PETRICCA NOTE:
	> We will need to log the literals from any SUBJECT that is returned.  This
	is a great statistic that we can use to prioritize improvements to the
	analyzation on the Luis query results.
		> I am thinking that checking to see if the subject is a module or package
		it would be easy to map to a link for that module/package, especially if it
		is frequently queried (numpy?).
		> Is it a project system? (RTVS, NTVS, PTVS?)

DOCUMENTATION:

Bot.Agent.Agent.clarify.validate_input
	- What: 
		The number of valid options being returned.
	- Message:  
		  We want this number to be low.  Why? The purpose
		of the function clarify is to narrow down selections so that
		the user can get a better suggestion from the bot.
		  When there are more than one option being returned as valid
		as valid input it is usually an indication of less than
		desirable interpretation of the user's query prior to clarify
		being called, which is logic that is decoupled from the method 
		clarify entirely.

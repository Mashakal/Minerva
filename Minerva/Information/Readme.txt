What is the best way to seed the system to match the information that you've entered in the System.py file?
 - Once you have the starting LINKS object you should begin creating the KEY_MAP object.  It is important that
LUIS is seeded with sample queries for each of the branch of the key map, where a branch is considered to be any
key whose value is a dictionary.
	TODO:  Is there a way to automate seeding the system and also labeling the entities when the query is sent?

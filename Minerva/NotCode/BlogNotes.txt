How to tryout different entities/intents with the same utterances.
	"Seeding your Luis app, especially while your bot is in the early development stages, can be time consuming.
	When you consider the time invested in seeding a Luis application with utterances, labeling the intents and 
	all the entities in each utterance, and the fact that coming up with the best entity and intent types is far
	from the easy part you can definitely come to see why it might be beneficial to be able to port your utterances
	from one application to another, so that you can see how Luis works with a different set of entities.
	
	I have found that it is helpful to learn a little bit about the ntlk package and some of it's very easy to use
	classes and functions.  When you have a basic understanding of how NLP happens on a string of text, it makes it
	significantly easier for you to develop entities and intents that compliment the algorithms used in a natural
	language processor."


A generic bot framework.
	"I have taken special care in the consideration of the design for this bot framework.  You need not use it for
	a visual studio extension, nor even anything related to an IDE.  You can integrate this framework into any case
	where there is a finite set of information.  What does this mean?  Well, considering that all human knowledge can
	be considered a finite set of information, the bot framework is extremely scalable.  However, one big area of 
	improvement needs to be made in managing the information files inside of the information module.  You know, the ones
	that are very tightly coupled to the data.  It was also extremely onerous to have to add the triggers to each key.

	It is probably better to maintain a mapping of the keys (but what if it changes).
